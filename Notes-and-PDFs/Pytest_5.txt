PYTEST NOTES:

1. Innstallation: pip install PYTEST
2. Test File Creation: Create files named test_*.py or *_test.py
3. Test Function Naming: Start functions names with test_*
4. Assertions: Use Python's bi+uilt in assert statement.
5. Class Naming: Start class names with Test*
6. Method Naming: Start method names with test_

MASTERING PYTEST FIXTURES:

1. Reusable Setup and Teardown: Fixtures defines functions executed before and after tests
2. Scoping: Control fixture behaviour(function, module, session etc.)
3. Parameterization: Run tests with different input data using fixtures. 


LEVELING UP WITH PYTEST:
1. MARKING: Test Marking: Ctaegorize tests with marks for selective execution
2. EXPAND: Parameterization: Expand test coverage with variations
3. INTEGRATE: Plugins: Integrate Tools for reporting, code coverage and more
4. COMMAND: Command-line options: Customize test execution


NOTE: Getting error while using - from main import add and from . import add
Corrected by using - from .main import add. See the topic of relative imports in python.
