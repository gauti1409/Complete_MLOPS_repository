1. YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language
2. It is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. It can also be used in conjunction with other programming languages.

3. YAML Syntax:
- Uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting.
- Whitespaces for indentation and Tab are not allowed.
- No format symbols like braces, square brackets or quotation tags.
- Uses .yml or .yaml file extension

4. YAML Structure:
- Structure of a YAML File is a map or a list.
- Maps allow us to associate key-value pairs.
- Keys are unique, and the order doesn't matter.
- A map in YAML needs to be resolved before it can be closed, and a new map is created. 

5. YAML Data Types:
- Scalar values - Strings, Integers, dates, numbers and Boolean.
- A list(collection of items) and it can start with a dash, with indentation separating the parent. 
- New Map can be created by either increasing indentation level or by resolving the previous map.  

6 # is used for writing the comments in YAML File. 

7. We always use lowercase in the YAML File as best practices.
